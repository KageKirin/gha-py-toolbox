name: GH MACRO download published registry_package
description: >
  Downloads published registry package files using the following actions:
  - gh/download-published-nuget-package
  - gh/download-published-npm-package
  - gh/download-published-package

  Returns a whitespace-separated list of the downloaded packages, i.e.
  the result of joining the outputs from the aforementioned actions.

  This can only be called from a `on-registry_package[published]` job as below,
  as it requires the data structure specific to `github.event.registry_package`.
  Further, permissions must be set as below:

  ```
  on:
    registry_package:
      types: [published]

  jobs:
    upload:
      permissions:
        packages: read  #<-- access packages
    runs-on: xxx-latest
    steps:
    - id: download-package
      name: Download published package
      uses: kagekirin/gha-py-toolbox/actions/gh/download-published-npm-package@main
      with:
        registry_package_json: $ {{ toJSON(github.event.registry_package) }}
        token: $ {{ github.token }}
  ```

inputs:
