# GitHub Actions Python Toolbox (`gha-py-toolbox`)

This repo contains a collection of actively used GitHub Actions
implemented in Python :snake:.

This collection came alive due to the following facts:

* GitHub Actions can be invoked from any other action or workflow,
  given their canonical path,
  and don't need to be published on the GitHub Actions Marketplace.

* GitHub Actions can be scriped in Python, whiches do not need to depend
  on a specific OS.
  The actions are thus cross-platform (or at least intended to be).

* Python is much clearer language to write scripts, compared to Bash,
  PowerShell or DOS. The overhead to calling native programs is minimal,
  and the usual need to rely on external tools such as ripgrep, fd-find, etc
  is easily gapped by the language itself, or its many libraries.
