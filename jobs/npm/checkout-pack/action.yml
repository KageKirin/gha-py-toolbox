    required: false
  package:
    description: >
      Package name.
      Overrides the package name already set in package.json.

      May include the scope if the scope is part of the package name (the way it's
      handled for regular NPM packages).
      Note: might also require to write the package name (e.g.) `@scope/package-name`
      as
      either `%40scope%2Fpackage-name` or `@scope%2Fpackage-name` depending on the
      registry server.

      GitHub (Enterprise): add scope to registry URL and not to package name.
      Unity/UPM: `package-name` includes the tld-scope, i.e. `tld.owner.packagename`
    required: false
